          The Sleep Garden is a mobile app that help people form healthy habits
          that are beneficial to their sleep. By gamifying the process of
          habit-forming, the app prompts users to repeat daily healthy habits.
          In the Sleep Garden, users will grow plants that represent their
          habits and eventually form a garden.

          <h3>Personas</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          I conducted both quantitative and qualitative research. I researched
          the science facts on sleep. I also interviewed 10 people, gained
          insights from their responses, and created two personas for my app.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center mt-4">
          <img
            class="mb-2"
            src="./images/interaction1-2.jpg"
            alt="Patty's User Journey"
          />
          <h3>Patty's User Journey</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The user journey demonstrates the desired outcomes of using the app.
          It would facilitate her to cut one coffee in the afternoon, do some
          simple exercises after she arrives home, and meditate before she
          sleeps. With a healthier lifestyle, she can attain higher-quality
          sleep.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center mt-4">
          <img
            class="mb-2"
            src="./images/interaction1-3.jpg"
            alt="Low Fidelity Wireframes"
          />
          <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In my low-fidelity prototype, I focused on the onboarding process and
          the flow of the entire app. Because the Sleep Garden has a graphical
          interface, I put in rough drawings even in low-fidelity wireframes to
          give interviewees context.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center mt-4">
          <img
            class="mb-2"
            src="./images/interaction1-4.jpg"
            alt="High Fidelity Wireframes"
          />
          <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Based on the critique and user testing results, I added more features
          related to sleep. It also has more refined illustrations and
          micro-interactions.
