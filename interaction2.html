        <p>
          The final project of the class is to create multi-screen interactions
          for an interactive documentary based on topics discussed in class. I'm
          working with Sakura Luo on the topic of Beta Culture, which is the
          prevalence of software companies releasing beta version softwares.

          <h3>Ideation Sketches</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          We first did 15 pages of ideation sketches. After several rounds of
          critiques, we decided to pursue one of the ideas. The documentary will
          have a desktop and a mobile part. The desktop will play a beta version
          of the documentary, and the mobile will be a chatbot for users to
          offer feedback. The documentary will keep getting better as users
          provide more feedback.

          <h3>User Scenario, Techie</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          We identified three potential users for the documentary: <br />
          1. Techies who want to better understand beta culture <br />
          2. Students who are researching related fields<br />
          3. Teachers who teaches the topic on beta culture.

          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          After conducting card sort research, we came up with an information
          architecture for the documentary. Based on the critique we got, we
          also added the chatbot function to the desktop.
