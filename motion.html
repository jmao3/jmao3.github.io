          This project aims to animate designer Dieter Rams’ Ten Principles of
          Good Design. In this short writing, Rams talks about what he believes
          to be the criteria of good design. By going through the design process
          , I was able to create an animation from scratch and understand how
          each step contribute to the final product.

          <h3>Mood Board</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In my mood board, I selected various products Dieter Rams designed, as
          well as designs from Apple to convey a calm, minimalistic feeling.

          <h3>Design Board</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          My design boards have a persistent light grey background dark grey
          text. The overall style is monochromatic and calm. There are moments
          of scale shifts and color change to create visual interests.

          This project animates the commerial of the app “fair”. The app allows
          people to own cars in a new way. The original commercial is playful
          and light-mooded; I want to replicate that in my animation using
          colorful illustrations.

          <h3>Mood Board</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          After researching similar commercials, I chose playful illustrations
          with bright colors and dynamic compositions, which best grab viewers'
          attention.

          <h3>Design Board</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          For the design boards, I used the orange from the app logo with a
          complementary blue as my major colors. After I finished my design
          boards and started animating, I realized my design boards did not work
          for a couple of scenes because I did not think about the transitions
          in between, so I had to remake parts of the design boards in my
          animation.
